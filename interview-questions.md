# UNIT 1 ASSESSMENT: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: if you don't know the answer try answering a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: It is a logical thinking in computer terms. I would compaire it to an else if statement. 

Researched answer: If a specified condition is true then it will execute that code, if the condition is false then that block of code is skipped.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: I view git in terms of mailing a letter. Before shipping our letter(code) we want to box all our stuff(git add .) then print a label(git commit -m"") and finally we can send our box out(git push). So git to me is a staging area for our code. The difference between git and Github is that git is a staging area for developers to work on projects and github is the final destination for the code to be reviewed.

Researched answer: Git allows developers to work, experiment and share ideas on the same project before merging back to the main repository. Github is built around Git and is used to share code between developers. 

2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An arrays index starts at 0 and its value is the element at that index. Example random array = [10, 20, 30]: 10 is at index 0 and 20 is at index 1. the value at index 0 is 10, the value at index 2 is 20.

Researched answer: an index is the position of an element in the array and starts at 0 and a value is the actual stored data within that index

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Simmilar: both hold data, can be manipulated 
How they are different: arrays can hold strings but strings cannot hold arrays

Researched answer: both are a collection of data that hold individual elements usind indexes, can itterate over indexes with loops. 
    They are different in the fact that strings are a sequence of characters and arrays are a collection of elements. strings hold data representing text and arrays can hold characters numbers and bulean values

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. Encapsulation: grouping data and methods into a single class. 
abstraction: hiding details of an application from the outer world
inheritance: classes inherit attributes and methods of another class
polymorphism: a specific routine to use variables of different types at different time. 
These are very confusing 


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Objects: collection of key value pairs. they can can contain static information 

2. Classes: like functions classes are reusable and customizable, blueprints of objects

3. React: a JS library for creating UI. they are reusable and each component contains it own functionality
